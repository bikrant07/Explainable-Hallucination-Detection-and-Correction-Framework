# Explainable Hallucination Detection and Correction Framework

## Overview
This project explores methods to detect and correct hallucinations in AI-generated outputs with a focus on **explainability**. The framework combines detection techniques with correction strategies to improve reliability, transparency, and trust in AI systems. It is designed for research and educational purposes, with emphasis on understanding why hallucinations occur and how they can be mitigated.
